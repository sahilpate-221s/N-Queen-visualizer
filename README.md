# N-Queens Visualizer

Explore the N-Queens problem visually: input board size, see queens placed, and conflicts highlighted. Enjoy an intuitive interface for a seamless solving experience.


## Description
The N-Queens Problem Solver is a web-based application designed to visualize solutions to the classic N-Queens problem. This problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The application allows users to input the size of the chessboard (N) and dynamically displays the placement of queens as they are calculated using a backtracking algorithm.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Users can input the board size (N) and observe the real-time solution process.
- **Queen Placement Visualization:** Dynamic display of queen placements on the chessboard as the algorithm progresses.
- **Conflict Detection:** Immediate visual indication of conflicts between queens on the board.
- **Backtracking Algorithm:** Efficiently solves the N-Queens problem using a recursive backtracking approach.
- **User Interaction:** Supports user interaction through a simple form submission to initiate the solving process.
- **Visual Feedback:** Utilizes color coding to differentiate between safe and threatened positions for queens.
- **Board State Management:** Maintains and updates the state of the chessboard dynamically during the solving process.
- **Solution Display:** Renders the final solution with all queens placed correctly on the board.
- **Responsive Behavior:** Adapts display and interaction to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensures smooth execution with asynchronous updates and optimized algorithmic performance.
## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm Harshit Koshta, a student passionate about technology and currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cloud Computing with a focus on Computer Science Engineering at Lovely Professional University. I've developed the N-Queens Problem Solver project to explore algorithmic problem-solving and enhance my skills in web development.

Designed to visualize solutions to the classic N-Queens problem, our project dynamically places queens on an NÃ—N chessboard, highlighting their positions and conflicts in real-time. It's an educational tool that demonstrates the power of backtracking algorithms in a visual and interactive way.

I'm excited to share this project with you and invite you to explore the world of problem-solving through our N-Queens Problem Solver. Let's delve into algorithms, visualize solutions, and enjoy the journey of learning and discovery together!
